## 🎞️ Parallax Character Scroll Reveal

Ever wanted your favorite anime characters to gracefully appear one after another as you scroll? 🌸
Well, now they can~ ✨

This component gives you a parallax-powered scroll experience where each scroll reveals a new character, complete with animated image, name, and description. Only one character gets the spotlight at a time (no stealing the stage, senpai 😏), with smooth motion effects to keep the magic flowing.

### 🛠️ Built With Love (and Code)

- ⚛️ React – our trusty framework
- 📜 JavaScript – the language of web spells
- 🎭 Framer Motion – smooth anime-like transitions
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS – stylish and flexible
- ⚡ Vite – super fast bundling magic

### ✨ Features

- 🌟 Scroll-to-reveal characters – with image, name & description
- 🎐 Smooth, natural animations – like wind through sakura petals
- 📱 Responsive design – works beautifully across all screen sizes
- 🧙 Single spotlight – one character at a time, no crowding the stage!

### 🚀 Why it’s cool

Because scrolling through plain text is boring, Kuro-kun 🥱
With this, your page becomes an anime character showcase that feels dynamic, lively, and… kinda magical 💖
